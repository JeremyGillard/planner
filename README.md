## Description

During previous confinements, I have noticed that it was easy days after days to forget accomplished tasks when days look like the same and working days are getting long. I then took as a reflex during my last quad trimester to regularly note and schedule my day to day and week to week objectives. First of all for planning reasons and secondly to allow me to have an easy retrospective on tasks and work done previously.

Until then I was doing that on paper. Now that I am searching for projects to improve and demonstrate my web development skills, I find that it would be cool if I make an application of it. I would then allow me to keep track of all of this without to have to think about the owner of those informations (wink to famous agenda applications).
